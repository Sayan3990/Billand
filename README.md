## Billand and Billo

#### Eww! "Billand" - it's completely a hypothetical world, the whole story was written by me and I am so bad in literature. It's just for fun.

## History
- In 2020, I have started with web development. I have gone through HTML and CSS. After acquiring some basics of HTML/CSS, I have tried to design [this website](https://billand-by-sayan.netlify.app/). It was my very first website as practice with pure HTML/CSS and Js. 
- Now, I am updating it with my recent projects.

      <h6>What's Billand?</h6>
      <p>Basically 'Billand' came from land of billos, it means where people use to say Billo as a basic         conversation word, after knowing its advantage. So if we take bil from 'Billo' and add  land, it comes Billand.
      </P>
        <br/>
      <P>
        Previously name of 'Billand' was 'Salmland'. They could use Biloland but may be they thought that it was slightly odd to hear as compare to Billand. But there is a history behind this name, you can read it from the section <a href="#history">“History of Billand“</a>. However people are feeling free
        so say Billo at all. That's why the land is known as 'Billand'.
      </p>

      <h6>What does Billo mean in Billand?</h6>
      <p>If we think a specific situation, when you haven't sufficient word for explanation or may be you can’t  remember perfect word at a time in conversation and fail to explain meaning of real fact. Misunderstanding comes. It can be a cause of quarrel. Using inappropriate words, can express a different meaning rather than what you want to say.
       In this case the concept of saying 'Billo' comes, now you say Billo, the environment of conversation will express you views. Speaker's body language matters here. Not only you expressions but also the way, in which you are telling, will give the answer. You can use it once, instead of saying any abuse word.
      </p>

    <div class="myimage4" id="history">
      <h6>History behind Billand</h6>
      <p>One day little boy of Slamland, heard ‘Billo’ from a anime series. The word is too much funny to him and also related to cat. Actually he loves cats and never fails to say meow to see a cat. He used to say ‘Billo’ now, a new crazy word. Day by day, it became a habit for him to say ‘Billo’ to anyone.
        But he didn’t know the meaning of ‘Billo’. One day an elder guy suddenly asked him, the reason for saying ‘Billo’ to someone - is it a abuse word ? He hasn't any answer. But he thought. Finally he found out that we could use it in basic
        conversation instead of saying inappropriate words. Then the word ‘Billo’ got famous among teenagers. They feel fun to say so. Now, people of Slamland learnt to say ‘Billo’ and the name, ‘Slamland’ became today’s ‘Billand’.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myimage3" id="people">
      <h6>People in Billand!</h6>
      <p>People of billand are feeling free to say ‘Billo’. Why not, it is a quite frankie word. It doesn't matter to anyone in Billand. They are happy with the word ‘Billo’. It has influence on their life-style and thinkings. Now people use ‘Billo’ as their surname. Even, they also created secondary words related to it, like ’Istambillo’, ‘Sugudugubillo’, ‘Sambabillo’, ‘Billobillo’.
      </p>
          <br>
        <p>
        They made division for male and female, that ‘Billo’ is applicable for females and male are introduced by ‘Billa’. But they use to say ‘Billo’ to all rather than gender division. After all, we all are same, having same potential to do. No doubt, ‘Billo’ is quite funny to say. You can try once with your friends. have fun. </p>
